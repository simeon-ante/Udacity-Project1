    "\n",
    "This dataset contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb). The information collected about these movies have been organised into 21 columns and they include: Title, Genre, imdb_id, revenue, budget e.t.c.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question(s) for Analysis\n",
    "For my analysis, I would be asking the following questions\n",
    "1. What is the average budget of the better movies? (Where better movies are those with vote_average grater than the mean vote_average)\n",
    "2. Is there any correlation between genre and budget? What genres have the highest and lowest budgets?\n",
    "3. What months had better performing movies (in terms of revenue)?\n"

    "> **Tip**: Now that you've trimmed and cleaned your data, you're ready to move on to exploration. **Compute statistics** and **create visualizations** with the goal of addressing the research questions that you posed in the Introduction section. You should compute the relevant statistics throughout the analysis when an inference is made about the data. Note that at least two or more kinds of plots should be created as part of the exploration, and you must  compare and show trends in the varied visualizations. \n",

Look at one variable at a time, and then follow it up by looking at relationships between variables. You should explore at least three variables in relation to the primary question. This can be an exploratory relationship between three variables of interest, or looking at how two independent variables relate to a single dependent variable of interest. Lastly, you  should perform both single-variable (1d) and multiple-variable (2d) explorations.\n",
